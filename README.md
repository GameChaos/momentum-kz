## What is this?

This is a WIP fork of momentum mod where KZ players can test different game mechanics and will hopefully help decide what will eventually be in the real Climb gamemode in Momentum Mod!

## How do I install this???

1. Download and install the 0.8.7 public build of Momentum Mod from here: https://github.com/momentum-mod/game/releases/tag/0.8.7-public-eval
2. Download the latest release of Momentum-KZ from here: https://github.com/GameChaos/momentum-kz/releases
3. Extract the Momentum-KZ .zip file into the root of your 0.8.7 installation folder (same folder where hl2.exe is).
4. Extract the Momentum-KZ-Maps folder into the maps/ folder.
